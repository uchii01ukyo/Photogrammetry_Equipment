# Photogrammetry
Proposal for 3D recording of physical experiments using photogrammetry.
(ex: physical experiments = experiments of soil fracture behavior) 
  
### What Photogrammetry?
A method of photographing a subject from various angles and integrating the digital images to create a three-dimensional 3DCG model.
